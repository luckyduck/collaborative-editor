Collaborative Editor

This is a very basic, but generally working, collaborative editor. It was
created in 2004 as a Java fun project, invented because we wanted to 
be able to work together on the same document over a local area network during
school lessons. We had no access to things like etherpad or SubEthaEdit which
was available on MacOSX or something, and wrote our own solution. Iirc, 
it helped us to save some time actually: we don't had to write down
notes during the lessons redundantly. 

It has still some flaws, though. For example, if text is inserted over the
network, the cursor doesn't move automagically. We don't wanted to
throw everything away this little piece of our history and decided
to publish the code using the GPL license.
